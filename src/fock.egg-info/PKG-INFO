# Fock

A continuous variable quantum neural network simulating framework written in PyTorch. 

The name of the package comes from the fact that the Fock basis representation is used as the  munderlining mathematics.

It is forked from strawberryfields==0.10.0.



# Development Notes (Don't look)

torch.einsum('i,j->ij', x, y)

$|x\rangle \otimes |y \rangle = x_i y_j$ 

torch.einsum: Multiply each component of each operand then sum if possible.

Tensor product genralizes outer product.







In the same directory as `setup.cfg`

```
pip install -e .
```





```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade build
```

```
python3 -m build
```

```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade twine
```

```
python3 -m twine upload dist/*
```









# How to debug



env1 strawberryfields==0.10.0 + old tensorflow ; updated pytorch + fock

they outputs numpy, compare the numpy for stress test
